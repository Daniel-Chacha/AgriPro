This project contains a simple Machine Learning model for yield prediction. Due to github's upload file size restrictions, I was not able to upload the crop_yield_model.pkl.

However, I uploaded a zipped version of it which can be found in Machine_Learning directory inside mysite directory (mysite/Machine_Learning/crop_yield_model.pkl).


Please unzip the file inside the directory before starting the evaluation of the project as the prediction view depends on this file to predict crop yields.
